## This is a project for custom "Docker" containerization tool.
This code demonstrates how to create a basic container using the clone() system call and several Linux system calls to manage namespaces and networking.
The main() function is responsible for creating the container and its namespaces. It uses the clone() function to create a new child process with its own PID, network, IPC, mount, and UTS namespaces. The child process then configures a network connection between the parent and child namespaces using veth pairs and sets up an IP address on the virtual network interface veth0 using the setip() function.
The child process sets its hostname to "myhost" and mounts a virtual storage device at / home using the mount() function. It then runs a benchmark script using the system() function to measure the performance of the container. After that, it creates a new virtual network interface veth1 using the setip() function and starts a new shell process using the clone() function. Finally, it unmounts the virtual storage device and terminates.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to create a basic container using Linux system calls and C programming language. It can be used as a starting point for more complex container implementations.
